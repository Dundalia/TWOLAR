Named after Alan Turing, the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, the award is often dubbed the 'Nobel Prize of Computer Science.' Established in 1966, it is conferred annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to an individual or a group who made major contributions to the field of computer science.\",\n",

While this award bears his name and is given in the domain of computer science, its significance in terms of academic recognition remains underappreciated.\",\n",
